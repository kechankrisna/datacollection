          "<h3><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h3>\r\nThis Privacy Policy explains how O.N.E Solution (“O.N..E”, “us”, “we” or “our”) collect, use, disclose, transfer, protect, store and otherwise process your information. It also explains your rights and options around our use of your personal information and how you can exercise these choices.\r\n\r\n’Personal information’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this Policy, ‘Customer’, as the term is used here, refers to an individual or an entity that registers to use our Services.\r\n\r\nPlease, do not use Services if you are not ready to accept the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\nThis Privacy Policy was updated on 24 May 2018.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><strong>Scope of privacy policy</strong></h3>\r\nO.N.E is committed to protecting the privacy of the individuals on O.N.E websites, mobile applications, products and services, (collectively, \"Services\").\r\n\r\nBy registering for or using Services you acknowledge the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information, as described in this Privacy Policy.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Customer Information, being personal information relating to our Customers (where applicable). We collect this information so that we can provide our Services to those Customers. For the purposes of GDPR in the European Union, we are the 'data controller' (where applicable) of this Customer Information and we collect and store it for the purposes of providing our Services to Customers and maintaining records and contact details relating to those Services and Customers. This policy sets out how O.N.E process your information as a Customer.</li>\r\n \t<li>Consumer information, being personal information relating to consumers with whom our Customers interact (such as consumers of their products or services) including their email address, phone number or other information.</li>\r\n \t<li>Employee information, being personal information relating to employees of our Customers, including email address, phone number or other information.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nCustomers are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as all privacy policies, agreements or other obligations, relating to the collection of personal information in connection with the use of our Services by individuals with whom our Customers interact. We collect information under the direction of our Customers, and have no direct relationship with individuals whose personal information we process in connection with the use of our Services. If you are a Customer providing information (including personal information) about someone else, you must have the legal ability to do so and, if necessary, inform them about how their personal information will be used (as described in this Privacy Policy). If you are an individual who interacts with a Customer using our Services - for instance if you’re an employee or consumer of a retail store – that Customer is the controller of your information and you should contact them directly (e.g. - the owner or manager of the retail store) – for assistance with any requests or questions relating to your personal information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><strong>What information we collect</strong></h3>\r\nWe collect information about you when you provide it to us, when you use our Services. The ways we collect it can be broadly categorized into the following:\r\n<h3><strong>INFORMATION YOU DIRECTLY PROVIDE TO US:</strong></h3>\r\n<strong>Account and profile information.</strong> We collect following information about you when you register for an account, create or modify your profile, set preferences, sign-up for or make purchases through the Services:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Contact information such as name, email address and country</li>\r\n \t<li>Profile information such as business phone number</li>\r\n \t<li>Preferences information such as notification and marketing preferences</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Operational data.</strong> We also store information you upload to or send through our Services, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Information about products and services the Customer sells (including inventory, pricing, sale, transaction, tax, and other data)</li>\r\n \t<li>Information about the Customer or the Customer’s business (employees, consumers and suppliers)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Information you provide through our support channels.</strong> The Services also include customer support, where you may choose to submit information regarding a problem you are experiencing with a Service . Whether you designate yourself as a technical contact, speak to one of our representatives directly or otherwise engage with our support team, we may ask you to provide contact information, a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue.\r\n\r\n<strong>Payment Information:</strong> We collect certain payment and billing information when you subscribe for certain paid Services. For example, we ask you to designate a billing representative, including name and contact information. You might also provide payment information, such as payment card details, which we collect via secure payment processing services.\r\n\r\n<strong>Other submissions.</strong> We ask for and collect personal information from you when you submit web forms on our websites or when you participate in any interactive features of our Services, participate in a survey, promotion, activity or event, request customer support, communicate with us via third party social media sites, or otherwise communicate with us.\r\n\r\n<strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY WHEN YOU USE THE SERVICES:</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Access logs.</strong> Like with most websites and services delivered over the Internet, we gather certain information and store it in log files when you interact with our websites and Services. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, language and location preferences, time/date stamp, search history, device identification numbers and system configuration information. Occasionally, we connect personal information to information gathered in our log files as is necessary to improve our Services. If we do this, we would treat the combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\n<strong>Analytics information.</strong> We collect analytics information when you use our Services to help us improve our products and services. We are always aiming to make Services a better experience for retailers and customers alike, and your information really helps us to do this! This analytics information consists of the function and feature of the Services being used, and the Customer's username and IP address of the individual who is using the function or feature (which will include any personal information incorporated into the username), and other information needed to detail the operation of the function and the parts of the Services that are being affected.\r\n\r\nWe use Google Analytics as one of our analytics providers. Refer to Google's Policies and Principles to find out more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics. To prevent analytics information from being sent to Google Analytics, use the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.\r\n<strong>Analytics information derived from operational data.</strong> Analytics information also consists of data we collect as a result of running queries against Operational Data across our user base for the purposes of generating Usage Data. \"Usage Data\" is aggregated data about a category or group of features, services, or users that is not of itself personal information. It is also data about our Customers and their business.\r\n\r\nWe may incidentally come across personal information when we compile Usage Data.\r\n<strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies are used by O.N.E and our third party partners (for example, our analytics partners) to collect information. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your hard drive or in device memory for record keeping purposes. We use cookies to give you a better and more personalised use of the Services, to save you logging in every time and to count the number of visits.\r\n<strong>INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER SOURCES</strong>\r\n\r\nWe collect information from other sources, such as our business partners. We do not control, supervise or respond for how the third parties providing your information process your personal data, and any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information to us should be directed to such third parties.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Legal justification for processing</strong>\r\n\r\nWe collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;</li>\r\n \t<li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests;</li>\r\n \t<li>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or</li>\r\n \t<li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How we use your information</strong>\r\n\r\nWe are continually striving to improve Services. Being able to identify how retailers are using our product plays a big part in helping us to make our software better. We may use information about you for purposes such as:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Enabling you to access and use our Services</li>\r\n \t<li>Displaying historical sale information</li>\r\n \t<li>Sending you marketing, advertising, educational content and promotional messages and other information that may be of interest to you, including information about us, our Services, or general promotions for business partner campaigns and services. You can unsubscribe or opt-out from receiving these communications described below under “How You Can Protect Your Information”</li>\r\n \t<li>In the case of retail stores, to share the name of the retail store with potential customers to encourage them to use our Services</li>\r\n \t<li>Measuring, customising and improving the Services and developing new products</li>\r\n \t<li>Sending to you service, support and administrative messages, reminders, technical notices, updates, security alerts and information requested by you</li>\r\n \t<li>Investigating and preventing fraudulent transactions, unauthorised access to Services, and other illegal activities</li>\r\n \t<li>With your consent: We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above. For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhere we need your personal information for any other purposes, it will be obvious from the circumstances as to the purposes for which we require that personal information from you.\r\n<h3><strong>Sharing &amp; disclosure of your information</strong></h3>\r\nWhen you use the Services, we may share your information only as described below:\r\n\r\nSERVICE PROVIDERS, BUSINESS PARTNERS AND OTHERS\r\n\r\nWe use and work with third party service providers and our trusted Business Partners to provide application development, hosting, website, infrastructure, maintenance, backup, payment processing, customer relationship management, marketing, accounting, human resources, business intelligence and analytics, data enrichment, customer support and other services for us. These service providers may have access to or process your information for the purpose of providing those services for us. Some of our pages use white-labelling techniques to serve content from our service providers while providing the look and feel of our site. Please note that you are providing your information to these third parties acting on behalf of O.N.E. These third parties are located in countries which may be outside of your location.\r\nWe also share your contact information with select trusted Business Partners, such as our partners who integrate with Services, to enable them to contact you about their services (as they relate to your Services). We also obtain contact information from select Business Partners to better understand your preferences and to deliver you more personalised marketing.\r\nLINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES\r\n\r\nOur Services may contain links to other sites. We have no control over, and take no responsibility for, the privacy practices or content on other sites. You are responsible for checking the privacy policy of any such sites so that you can be informed of how they handle personal information.\r\nSOCIAL MEDIA WIDGETS\r\n\r\nOur Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button and widgets, and the “Share” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.\r\nCOMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND PROTECTION OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\nIn certain situations, we may be required to use and disclose your information (including personal information) to a third party if we believe the disclosure is reasonably necessary:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>To comply with any applicable law, legal process (for example, subpoenas and warrants) or governmental request</li>\r\n \t<li>To enforce and administer our agreements, policies and terms of use</li>\r\n \t<li>To protect the property, rights, and safety of O.N.E, our Customers or the public from harm or illegal activities</li>\r\n \t<li>For fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation, customer support, product development or debugging purposes</li>\r\n \t<li>To protect the rights, property or personal safety of O.N.E, its users or members of the public</li>\r\n \t<li>To establish or exercise our legal rights or defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBUSINESS TRANSFERS\r\n\r\nIf O.N.E undertakes or is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets or bankruptcy or insolvency event, then we may transfer or share some or all of our assets, including your personal information. In this event, we will notify you before your personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\r\nNON-IDENTIFYING OR AGGREGATED DATA\r\n\r\nWe may share aggregated or other non-personal information that does not directly identify you with third parties in order to improve our Services.\r\n<h3><strong>Your Privacy Rights</strong></h3>\r\nUpdating your Personal Information via the Services: You may access, change, or correct information about you by logging into your Mylekha account at any time or by making a request to us using the contact details below, in which case we may need to verify your identity before granting access or otherwise changing or correcting your information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nACCOUNT INFORMATION AND DEACTIVATING YOUR ACCOUNT\r\n\r\nIf you wish to deactivate your Mylekha account, you may do so by emailing us using the contact details provided below.\r\nOPTING OUT OF PROMOTIONAL COMMUNICATIONS\r\n\r\nYou may opt out of receiving promotional communications from O.N.E by using the unsubscribe link within each email or contacting us via our home page or sales team. Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding Services (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, technical and security notices).\r\nYOUR EUROPEAN PRIVACY RIGHTS\r\n\r\nIn addition to the rights listed above, you have rights to:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Information about the processing of your personal data;</li>\r\n \t<li>Obtain access to the personal data held about you;</li>\r\n \t<li>Request that personal data be erased when it’s no longer needed or if processing it is unlawful;</li>\r\n \t<li>Object to the processing of your personal data for marketing purposes or on grounds relating to your particular situation;</li>\r\n \t<li>Request the restriction of the processing of your personal data in specific cases;</li>\r\n \t<li>Receive your personal data in a machine-readable format and send it to another controller (‘data portability’);</li>\r\n \t<li>Request that decisions based on automated processing concerning you or significantly affecting you and based on your personal data are made by natural persons, not only by computers. You also have the right in this case to express your point of view and to contest the decision.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you are an individual who interacts with a Customer using our Services - for instance if you’re an employee or consumer – that Customer is the controller of your information. If this is the case, please direct your data privacy request and questions to that controller, as your use of the Services is subject to that controller’s policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of such controllers, which may be different from this policy.\r\nIf you’re not happy with how we are processing your personal information, you have the right to complain to your local information protection authority. Your local data protection authority will be able to give you more information on how to submit a complaint.\r\nYou can request to exercise these rights by emailing <u><a href=\"mailto:support@mylekha.app\">support@mylekha.app</a></u>. We may need to verify your identity before granting access or otherwise changing or correcting your information.\r\nCOOKIES AND ADVERTISING\r\n\r\nYou may opt out of receiving cookies by instructing your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from websites you visit, by changing your browser options. Please read carefully our Cookies Policy.\r\nYou also can learn more about cookies by visiting <a href=\"http://www.allaboutcookies.org/\">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>, which includes useful information on cookies and how to block cookies on different types of browsers and mobile devices.\r\nPlease note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies used in Services, you may not be able to use all aspects of our Services.\r\n<h3><strong>Our global operations (including transfers of data from your home country to another)</strong></h3>\r\nTo bring you Services, we operate globally. In order to do so, your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in countries other than the country you live in, outside of your home country, including to Germany and the United States. These countries may have laws different to what you’re used to. Rest assured, where we disclose personal data to a third party in another country, we put safeguards in place to ensure your personal data remains protected.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, O.N.E hosts data with Amazon Web Services in the Germany. If you are a non-EU resident, this means that your personal information will be transferred to the Germany. The servers on which personal information is stored are kept in a controlled environment.\r\nEuropean Economic Area (EEA) users: This means that your information may be transferred outside of the EEA. Where your personal information is transferred outside the EEA, it will only be transferred to countries that have been deemed to provide adequate protection for EEA information (like US), or to a third party where we have approved transfer mechanisms in place to protect your personal information – i.e., by entering into the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, or by ensuring the entity is Privacy Shield certified.\r\n<h3><strong>How long we retain your information</strong></h3>\r\nWe generally retain your information only as long as reasonably necessary to provide you the Services or to comply with applicable law.\r\n\r\nHowever, even after you cancel your account, we can retain copies of information about you and any transactions or Services in which you may have participated for a period of time that is consistent with applicable law, applicable statute of limitations or as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, to resolve disputes, to address problems with our Services, to assist with investigations, to enforce our Terms of use or other applicable agreements or policies, or to take any other actions consistent with applicable law.\r\nWhen we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it.\r\n<h3><strong>Children’s use of the services</strong></h3>\r\nServices are not directed to individuals under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at the address listed below.\r\n<h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>\r\nWe have adopted technical, administrative and physical procedures to collect, manage, maintain and store information in a manner designed to help protect your information from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, and alteration. Unfortunately, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.\r\n\r\nWhere data is transferred over the Internet as part of the Services, the data is encrypted using industry standard TLS (HTTPS).\r\n<h3><strong>Updates to our privacy policy</strong></h3>\r\nO.N.E reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and if we do we will post any changes on this page. If you disagree with these changes, you can cancel your account at any time and/or stop your use of our Services. Your continued use of the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of such changes.\r\n<h3><strong>Do You Have Questions?</strong></h3>\r\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or O.N.E privacy practices, please contact us at <u><a href=\"mailto:support@mylekha.app\">support@mylekha.app</a></u> or at our mailing address below:\r\n\r\nO.N.E Solution\r\nBorey Academy, Svay Dongkum\r\nSiem reap, Cambodia\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

It also explains your rights and options around our use of your personal information and how you can exercise these choices.\r\n\r\n’Personal information’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this Policy, ‘Customer’, as the term is used here, refers to an individual or an entity that registers to use our Services.\r\n\r\nPlease, do not use Services if you are not ready to accept the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\nThis Privacy Policy was updated on 24 May 2018.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><strong>Scope of privacy policy</strong></h3>\r\nO.N.E is committed to protecting the privacy of the individuals on O.N.E websites, mobile applications, products and services, (collectively, \"Services\").\r\n\r\nBy registering for or using Services you acknowledge the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information, as described in this Privacy Policy.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Customer Information, being personal information relating to our Customers (where applicable). We collect this information so that we can provide our Services to those Customers. For the purposes of GDPR in the European Union, we are the 'data controller' (where applicable) of this Customer Information and we collect and store it for the purposes of providing our Services to Customers and maintaining records and contact details relating to those Services and Customers. This policy sets out how O.N.E process your information as a Customer.</li>\r\n \t<li>Consumer information, being personal information relating to consumers with whom our Customers interact (such as consumers of their products or services) including their email address, phone number or other information.</li>\r\n \t<li>Employee information, being personal information relating to employees of our Customers, including email address, phone number or other information.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nCustomers are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as all privacy policies, agreements or other obligations, relating to the collection of personal information in connection with the use of our Services by individuals with whom our Customers interact. We collect information under the direction of our Customers, and have no direct relationship with individuals whose personal information we process in connection with the use of our Services. If you are a Customer providing information (including personal information) about someone else, you must have the legal ability to do so and, if necessary, inform them about how their personal information will be used (as described in this Privacy Policy). If you are an individual who interacts with a Customer using our Services - for instance if you’re an employee or consumer of a retail store – that Customer is the controller of your information and you should contact them directly (e.g. - the owner or manager of the retail store) – for assistance with any requests or questions relating to your personal information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><strong>What information we collect</strong></h3>\r\nWe collect information about you when you provide it to us, when you use our Services. The ways we collect it can be broadly categorized into the following:\r\n<h3><strong>INFORMATION YOU DIRECTLY PROVIDE TO US:</strong></h3>\r\n<strong>Account and profile information.</strong> We collect following information about you when you register for an account, create or modify your profile, set preferences, sign-up for or make purchases through the Services:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Contact information such as name, email address and country</li>\r\n \t<li>Profile information such as business phone number</li>\r\n \t<li>Preferences information such as notification and marketing preferences</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Operational data.</strong> We also store information you upload to or send through our Services, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Information about products and services the Customer sells (including inventory, pricing, sale, transaction, tax, and other data)</li>\r\n \t<li>Information about the Customer or the Customer’s business (employees, consumers and suppliers)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Information you provide through our support channels.</strong> The Services also include customer support, where you may choose to submit information regarding a problem you are experiencing with a Service . Whether you designate yourself as a technical contact, speak to one of our representatives directly or otherwise engage with our support team, we may ask you to provide contact information, a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue.\r\n\r\n<strong>Payment Information:</strong> We collect certain payment and billing information when you subscribe for certain paid Services. For example, we ask you to designate a billing representative, including name and contact information. You might also provide payment information, such as payment card details, which we collect via secure payment processing services.\r\n\r\n<strong>Other submissions.</strong> We ask for and collect personal information from you when you submit web forms on our websites or when you participate in any interactive features of our Services, participate in a survey, promotion, activity or event, request customer support, communicate with us via third party social media sites, or otherwise communicate with us.\r\n\r\n<strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY WHEN YOU USE THE SERVICES:</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Access logs.</strong> Like with most websites and services delivered over the Internet, we gather certain information and store it in log files when you interact with our websites and Services. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, language and location preferences, time/date stamp, search history, device identification numbers and system configuration information. Occasionally, we connect personal information to information gathered in our log files as is necessary to improve our Services. If we do this, we would treat the combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\n<strong>Analytics information.</strong> We collect analytics information when you use our Services to help us improve our products and services. We are always aiming to make Services a better experience for retailers and customers alike, and your information really helps us to do this! This analytics information consists of the function and feature of the Services being used, and the Customer's username and IP address of the individual who is using the function or feature (which will include any personal information incorporated into the username), and other information needed to detail the operation of the function and the parts of the Services that are being affected.\r\n\r\nWe use Google Analytics as one of our analytics providers. Refer to Google's Policies and Principles to find out more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics. To prevent analytics information from being sent to Google Analytics, use the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.\r\n<strong>Analytics information derived from operational data.</strong> Analytics information also consists of data we collect as a result of running queries against Operational Data across our user base for the purposes of generating Usage Data. \"Usage Data\" is aggregated data about a category or group of features, services, or users that is not of itself personal information. It is also data about our Customers and their business.\r\n\r\nWe may incidentally come across personal information when we compile Usage Data.\r\n<strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies are used by O.N.E and our third party partners (for example, our analytics partners) to collect information. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your hard drive or in device memory for record keeping purposes. We use cookies to give you a better and more personalised use of the Services, to save you logging in every time and to count the number of visits.\r\n<strong>INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER SOURCES</strong>\r\n\r\nWe collect information from other sources, such as our business partners. We do not control, supervise or respond for how the third parties providing your information process your personal data, and any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information to us should be directed to such third parties.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Legal justification for processing</strong>\r\n\r\nWe collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;</li>\r\n \t<li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests;</li>\r\n \t<li>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or</li>\r\n \t<li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How we use your information</strong>\r\n\r\nWe are continually striving to improve Services. Being able to identify how retailers are using our product plays a big part in helping us to make our software better. We may use information about you for purposes such as:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Enabling you to access and use our Services</li>\r\n \t<li>Displaying historical sale information</li>\r\n \t<li>Sending you marketing, advertising, educational content and promotional messages and other information that may be of interest to you, including information about us, our Services, or general promotions for business partner campaigns and services. You can unsubscribe or opt-out from receiving these communications described below under “How You Can Protect Your Information”</li>\r\n \t<li>In the case of retail stores, to share the name of the retail store with potential customers to encourage them to use our Services</li>\r\n \t<li>Measuring, customising and improving the Services and developing new products</li>\r\n \t<li>Sending to you service, support and administrative messages, reminders, technical notices, updates, security alerts and information requested by you</li>\r\n \t<li>Investigating and preventing fraudulent transactions, unauthorised access to Services, and other illegal activities</li>\r\n \t<li>With your consent: We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above. For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhere we need your personal information for any other purposes, it will be obvious from the circumstances as to the purposes for which we require that personal information from you.\r\n<h3><strong>Sharing &amp; disclosure of your information</strong></h3>\r\nWhen you use the Services, we may share your information only as described below:\r\n\r\nSERVICE PROVIDERS, BUSINESS PARTNERS AND OTHERS\r\n\r\nWe use and work with third party service providers and our trusted Business Partners to provide application development, hosting, website, infrastructure, maintenance, backup, payment processing, customer relationship management, marketing, accounting, human resources, business intelligence and analytics, data enrichment, customer support and other services for us. These service providers may have access to or process your information for the purpose of providing those services for us. Some of our pages use white-labelling techniques to serve content from our service providers while providing the look and feel of our site. Please note that you are providing your information to these third parties acting on behalf of O.N.E. These third parties are located in countries which may be outside of your location.\r\nWe also share your contact information with select trusted Business Partners, such as our partners who integrate with Services, to enable them to contact you about their services (as they relate to your Services). We also obtain contact information from select Business Partners to better understand your preferences and to deliver you more personalised marketing.\r\nLINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES\r\n\r\nOur Services may contain links to other sites.

You are responsible for checking the privacy policy of any such sites so that you can be informed of how they handle personal information.\r\nSOCIAL MEDIA WIDGETS\r\n\r\nOur Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button and widgets, and the “Share” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.\r\nCOMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND PROTECTION OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\nIn certain situations, we may be required to use and disclose your information (including personal information) to a third party if we believe the disclosure is reasonably necessary:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>To comply with any applicable law, legal process (for example, subpoenas and warrants) or governmental request</li>\r\n \t<li>To enforce and administer our agreements, policies and terms of use</li>\r\n \t<li>To protect the property, rights, and safety of O.N.E, our Customers or the public from harm or illegal activities</li>\r\n \t<li>For fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation, customer support, product development or debugging purposes</li>\r\n \t<li>To protect the rights, property or personal safety of O.N.E, its users or members of the public</li>\r\n \t<li>To establish or exercise our legal rights or defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBUSINESS TRANSFERS\r\n\r\nIf O.N.E undertakes or is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets or bankruptcy or insolvency event, then we may transfer or share some or all of our assets, including your personal information. In this event, we will notify you before your personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\r\nNON-IDENTIFYING OR AGGREGATED DATA\r\n\r\nWe may share aggregated or other non-personal information that does not directly identify you with third parties in order to improve our Services.\r\n<h3><strong>Your Privacy Rights</strong></h3>\r\nUpdating your Personal Information via the Services: You may access, change, or correct information about you by logging into your Mylekha account at any time or by making a request to us using the contact details below, in which case we may need to verify your identity before granting access or otherwise changing or correcting your information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nACCOUNT INFORMATION AND DEACTIVATING YOUR ACCOUNT\r\n\r\nIf you wish to deactivate your Mylekha account, you may do so by emailing us using the contact details provided below.\r\nOPTING OUT OF PROMOTIONAL COMMUNICATIONS\r\n\r\nYou may opt out of receiving promotional communications from O.N.E by using the unsubscribe link within each email or contacting us via our home page or sales team. Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding Services (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, technical and security notices).\r\nYOUR EUROPEAN PRIVACY RIGHTS\r\n\r\nIn addition to the rights listed above, you have rights to:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Information about the processing of your personal data;</li>\r\n \t<li>Obtain access to the personal data held about you;</li>\r\n \t<li>Request that personal data be erased when it’s no longer needed or if processing it is unlawful;</li>\r\n \t<li>Object to the processing of your personal data for marketing purposes or on grounds relating to your particular situation;</li>\r\n \t<li>Request the restriction of the processing of your personal data in specific cases;</li>\r\n \t<li>Receive your personal data in a machine-readable format and send it to another controller (‘data portability’);</li>\r\n \t<li>Request that decisions based on automated processing concerning you or significantly affecting you and based on your personal data are made by natural persons, not only by computers. You also have the right in this case to express your point of view and to contest the decision.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you are an individual who interacts with a Customer using our Services - for instance if you’re an employee or consumer – that Customer is the controller of your information. If this is the case, please direct your data privacy request and questions to that controller, as your use of the Services is subject to that controller’s policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of such controllers, which may be different from this policy.\r\nIf you’re not happy with how we are processing your personal information, you have the right to complain to your local information protection authority. Your local data protection authority will be able to give you more information on how to submit a complaint.\r\nYou can request to exercise these rights by emailing <u><a href=\"mailto:support@mylekha.app\">support@mylekha.app</a></u>. We may need to verify your identity before granting access or otherwise changing or correcting your information.\r\nCOOKIES AND ADVERTISING\r\n\r\nYou may opt out of receiving cookies by instructing your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from websites you visit, by changing your browser options. Please read carefully our Cookies Policy.\r\nYou also can learn more about cookies by visiting <a href=\"http://www.allaboutcookies.org/\">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>, which includes useful information on cookies and how to block cookies on different types of browsers and mobile devices.\r\nPlease note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies used in Services, you may not be able to use all aspects of our Services.\r\n<h3><strong>Our global operations (including transfers of data from your home country to another)</strong></h3>\r\nTo bring you Services, we operate globally. In order to do so, your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in countries other than the country you live in, outside of your home country, including to Germany and the United States. These countries may have laws different to what you’re used to. Rest assured, where we disclose personal data to a third party in another country, we put safeguards in place to ensure your personal data remains protected.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, O.N.E hosts data with Amazon Web Services in the Germany. If you are a non-EU resident, this means that your personal information will be transferred to the Germany. The servers on which personal information is stored are kept in a controlled environment.\r\nEuropean Economic Area (EEA) users: This means that your information may be transferred outside of the EEA. Where your personal information is transferred outside the EEA, it will only be transferred to countries that have been deemed to provide adequate protection for EEA information (like US), or to a third party where we have approved transfer mechanisms in place to protect your personal information – i.e., by entering into the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, or by ensuring the entity is Privacy Shield certified.\r\n<h3><strong>How long we retain your information</strong></h3>\r\nWe generally retain your information only as long as reasonably necessary to provide you the Services or to comply with applicable law.\r\n\r\nHowever, even after you cancel your account, we can retain copies of information about you and any transactions or Services in which you may have participated for a period of time that is consistent with applicable law, applicable statute of limitations or as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, to resolve disputes, to address problems with our Services, to assist with investigations, to enforce our Terms of use or other applicable agreements or policies, or to take any other actions consistent with applicable law.\r\nWhen we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it.\r\n<h3><strong>Children’s use of the services</strong></h3>\r\nServices are not directed to individuals under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at the address listed below.\r\n<h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>\r\nWe have adopted technical, administrative and physical procedures to collect, manage, maintain and store information in a manner designed to help protect your information from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, and alteration. Unfortunately, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.\r\n\r\nWhere data is transferred over the Internet as part of the Services, the data is encrypted using industry standard TLS (HTTPS).\r\n<h3><strong>Updates to our privacy policy</strong></h3>\r\nO.N.E reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and if we do we will post any changes on this page. If you disagree with these changes, you can cancel your account at any time and/or stop your use of our Services. Your continued use of the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of such changes.\r\n<h3><strong>Do You Have Questions?</strong></h3>\r\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or O.N.E privacy practices, please contact us at <u><a href=\"mailto:support@mylekha.app\">support@mylekha.app</a></u> or at our mailing address below:\r\n\r\nO.N.E Solution\r\nBorey Academy, Svay Dongkum\r\nSiem reap, Cambodia\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

By clicking “Accept” or using any of the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these Terms, and that you have agreed to these Terms on behalf of any person or entity for whom you are using the Services.\r\n\r\nIf you do not agree to any of these Terms, then you should not use the Services. All rights not expressly granted in these Terms are reserved by O.N.E Click Solution.\r\n\r\nWe may change these Terms from time to time by posting updates to the Website. You are advised to check the Terms from time to time for any updates or changes that may impact you and if you do not accept such amendments, you must cease using the Services.\r\n\r\nThese Terms of Use were updated on 2 December 2020.\r\n<h2><strong>\r\n</strong>Definitions</h2>\r\nTo help you read and understand these Terms, we've set out definitions of some key terms below:\r\n\r\n\"Customer\" means the person or entity who registers to use the Service by creating a My Lekha account. If you are creating an account or using the Services on behalf of a business, you agree that you are accepting these Terms and have the authority to enter into these Terms, on behalf of the business, which will be deemed to be the Customer, and will be bound by these Terms.\r\n\r\n\"Authorised User\" means any person or entity that a Customer authorises to use the Service on its behalf. This includes employees and personnel of the Customer who are authorised to use the Services on the Customer's behalf, but also includes support partners and other third parties with whom a Customer shares its My Lekha account details (and for whose conduct the Customer is responsible).\r\n\r\n“Personal Data” means any Data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person), such as your first and last name, identity number, e-mail address, address and province, telephone number, education details and training records, employment data, financial and / or banking data, as well as other data related to demographics, other (online) contact data and possibly health related data, etc.\r\n\r\n“Sensitive Data” means any data revealing a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetics, biometrics, health data, data about sex life or sexual orientation, or data about criminal convictions and offences.\r\n\r\n\"We\" or \" My Lekha  \" O.N.E Click Solution\r\n\r\n\"Services\" means My Lekha  point of sale and inventory management products and services, and any features, technologies or functionality provided by those products or services, offered by us from time to time, including the My Lekha , My Lekha Dashboard, My Lekha KD and My Lekha CD applications (\"Apps\") and mylekha.app (\"Website\"). Your use of the Services will also be subject to any allowances and/or limits that apply to the Mylekha plan which you've purchased.\r\n\r\n\"Content\" – text, graphics, audio and video materials, documentation, information posted in Apps or Website, perceivable by a person or with the help of special devices.\r\n\r\n\"You\" means the Customer and (where the context permits) includes any Authorised Users.\r\n<h2><strong>\r\n</strong>Account information</h2>\r\nTo lawfully use our Services, you must be at least at the age your country of residence defines as the least age to offer information society services.\r\n\r\nYou agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete account information, and to maintain and promptly update your account information to ensure that it remains true, accurate, current, and complete. We will use that information to contact you from time to time, so it is important that you keep all of your contact details, and those of your Authorised Users, up to date.\r\n<h2><strong>\r\n</strong>Use of your account</h2>\r\nCavius grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to use the Services for the purposes of with the Customer's business and in accordance with these Terms.\r\n\r\nYou are responsible for any conduct or activity undertaken in your account, including any changes made, and the input or modification of or access to any data or information in your account, by any of your Authorised Users. You control each Authorised User’s level of access to the Services at all times and can revoke or change an Authorised User’s access, or level of access, at any time and for any reason, in which case that person or entity will cease to be an Authorised User or shall have that different level of access, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nIf:\r\n(a) you are an Authorised User using or accessing the Services for the benefit of an Customer, then you are responsible for ensuring you have the right to do so from the relevant Customer (including all necessary authorisations to access, amend or remove data, or make changes to the Customer's account); or\r\n(b) you are a Customer, then you are responsible for authorising use or access of the Services by any Authorised User and will indemnify Cavius against any claims or loss relating to any Authorised User's use of or access to your account.\r\n\r\nYou acknowledge and agree that, if there is any dispute between a Customer and an Authorised User regarding access to Services, the Customer shall decide what access or level of access to the relevant Data or Services that Authorized User shall have, if any. We will have no responsibility to anyone other than the Customer, and the Services and these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the Customer and not for any Authorised User(s).\r\n<h2><strong>\r\n</strong>Cancellation of accounts</h2>\r\nWe can cancel or suspend your account at any time on written notice to you. Such termination will be effective at the end of your then-current paid-up subscription period. We may also cancel or suspend your account immediately if, in our sole discretion:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>you have committed a material or persistent breach of these Terms or any other terms applying to your use of the Services;</li>\r\n \t<li>we consider that provision of the Services, or use of them, in your territory or jurisdiction will or is likely to breach any applicable law;</li>\r\n \t<li>we decide to withdraw the Services from your territory or jurisdiction altogether; or</li>\r\n \t<li>you fail to comply with any limits or restrictions (e.g, on the number of users, stores or transactions) applicable to your plan;</li>\r\n \t<li>your use of the account is creating a security or availability risk for Cavius International Limited or our other customers, is impacting (or may impact) the stability or performance of our systems, or is requiring disproportionate resource to deliver (eg, in terms of storage or processing requirements, support requests or helpdesk queries).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou are entitled to cancel your account with Cavius at any time. You can request to cancel your account by sending an email to support@mylekha.app. If you cancel your account before the end of your current paid up month or year, your cancellation will take effect immediately and you will not be entitled to any refund of Fees paid in advance (unless we agree otherwise).\r\n\r\nIf your account is cancelled, your account will be deactivated and all of your rights granted under these Terms will immediately come to an end (except to the extent that it is necessary for them to continue in respect of our ongoing storage of your data up to the date of permanent deletion). We are not liable for any loss or damage following, or as a result of, cancellation of your account, and it is your responsibility to ensure that any content or data which you require is exported, backed-up or replicated before cancellation.\r\n<h2><strong>\r\n</strong>Fees and taxes</h2>\r\nThe fees charged for use of the Services are set out on the Website (or as notified to you in the case of some exclusive plans) (\"Fees\") and are subject to change. We can change the Fees, and/or introduce new pricing packages and terms, at any time by giving you 14 days' prior notice. The new Fees or pricing/package terms will apply to you from expiry of that notice, unless you choose to cancel subscription before the changes take effect. Also, the new Fees will apply to you immediately if you choose to change your plan/package (or if you reactivate your plan after cancellation). Fees are charged in advance on a monthly or annual basis and are non-refundable, including if you only use part of a month or year's subscription for the Services. Unless required by law, we will not provide refunds in connection with the Services. A valid credit card number is required for paying all Fees.\r\n\r\nIf you are carrying out a free trial of the Services, the free trial will begin on the day that you subscribe for an optional add-on and end of the published trial period. If you wish to continue to use the Services at the end of the free trial period, you will need to provide valid credit card details (unless you choose to use any free Services). All Fees are exclusive of all taxes and you are responsible for any taxes that may arise. You indemnify and hold Mylekha armless against any claims by any tax authority for any underpayment of any sales, use, goods and services, value added or other tax or levy, and any penalties and/or interest. If you are required to withhold or deduct tax from the Fees, you will pay MyLekha such additional amounts as are necessary to ensure receipt of the full amount which would have been received but for the deduction.\r\n\r\nBy subscribing to optional add-ons, you agree and authorize us to automatically charge the payment method provided at the start of each billing period (monthly or annually) until you cancel the subscription.\r\n\r\nPayment of your Fees could incur additional bank fees at the discretion of your bank. Bank fees may be charged for currency conversion and international settlement; and your charge may still be subject to additional fees even if you are being charged by MyLekha in your local currency. If your credit card statement charge differs from your invoice, please contact your bank in the first instance. MyLekha is not liable for any additional bank transaction fees that may be charged.\r\n<h3><strong>\r\nYou may upgrade or downgrade your account at any time</strong></h3>\r\nYou may upgrade or downgrade your account (for example, add or delete employee accounts and stores, subscribe or unsubscribe from optional add-ons) at any time by when you are logged into your account.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade or downgrade will become effective immediately. If you downgrade your account, no refunds will be paid in respect of any unused portion of any higher account offering. If you upgrade your account, the balance already paid for the rest of the term will be credited to your account. We will then immediately charge your credit card for any net amount due as a result of the upgrade and your account renewal date will be reset to the next available billing day.\r\n\r\nDowngrading your account may cause the loss of content, features, or capacity of your account. If you choose to downgrade your account, Mylekha does not accept any liability for the resulting loss of data, content, features or capacity.\r\n<h3><strong>\r\nPlan limits and reasonable use</strong></h3>\r\nThe Services are available in a range of packages/plans, giving you options including in relation to the number of stores and employees you have, and the features and services you have access to, and the Fee you pay, as described on our Website from time to time (or as notified to you, in the case of some exclusive plans). We may update those plan limits at any time (eg, by increasing, reducing or removing limits) by updating the plan descriptions on our Website (or as notified to you, in the case of some exclusive plans). You'll be expected to comply with the updated plan limits from the next time you use the Services. You agree that we may use information generated by your use of the Services (eg, transaction volume and revenue) for the purposes of determining the most appropriate plan and pricing for you.\r\n\r\nWe may ask you to upgrade your account to a new plan if you exceed the limits that apply to your plan at any time.\r\n\r\nWe also reserve the right to suspend or restrict your account or your use of the Service, where we believe that your use isn't fair or reasonable or that it may cause degradation of the Services to other users. This includes circumstances where your use is creating a security or availability risk for Mylekha or our other customers, is impacting (or may impact) the stability or performance of our systems, or is requiring disproportionate resource to deliver (eg, in terms of storage or processing requirements, support requests or helpdesk queries).\r\n<h3><strong>\r\nDisclaimer of Warranties</strong></h3>\r\nTHE USE OF THE SERVICES IS CARRIED OUT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

By clicking “Accept” or using any of the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these Terms, and that you have agreed to these Terms on behalf of any person or entity for whom you are using the Services.\r\n\r\nIf you do not agree to any of these Terms, then you should not use the Services. All rights not expressly granted in these Terms are reserved by O.N.E Click Solution.\r\n\r\nWe may change these Terms from time to time by posting updates to the Website. You are advised to check the Terms from time to time for any updates or changes that may impact you and if you do not accept such amendments, you must cease using the Services.\r\n\r\nThese Terms of Use were updated on 2 December 2020.\r\n<h2><strong>\r\n</strong>Definitions</h2>\r\nTo help you read and understand these Terms, we've set out definitions of some key terms below:\r\n\r\n\"Customer\" means the person or entity who registers to use the Service by creating a My Lekha account. If you are creating an account or using the Services on behalf of a business, you agree that you are accepting these Terms and have the authority to enter into these Terms, on behalf of the business, which will be deemed to be the Customer, and will be bound by these Terms.\r\n\r\n\"Authorised User\" means any person or entity that a Customer authorises to use the Service on its behalf. This includes employees and personnel of the Customer who are authorised to use the Services on the Customer's behalf, but also includes support partners and other third parties with whom a Customer shares its My Lekha account details (and for whose conduct the Customer is responsible).\r\n\r\n“Personal Data” means any Data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person), such as your first and last name, identity number, e-mail address, address and province, telephone number, education details and training records, employment data, financial and / or banking data, as well as other data related to demographics, other (online) contact data and possibly health related data, etc.\r\n\r\n“Sensitive Data” means any data revealing a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetics, biometrics, health data, data about sex life or sexual orientation, or data about criminal convictions and offences.\r\n\r\n\"We\" or \" My Lekha  \" O.N.E Click Solution\r\n\r\n\"Services\" means My Lekha  point of sale and inventory management products and services, and any features, technologies or functionality provided by those products or services, offered by us from time to time, including the My Lekha , My Lekha Dashboard, My Lekha KD and My Lekha CD applications (\"Apps\") and mylekha.app (\"Website\"). Your use of the Services will also be subject to any allowances and/or limits that apply to the Mylekha plan which you've purchased.\r\n\r\n\"Content\" – text, graphics, audio and video materials, documentation, information posted in Apps or Website, perceivable by a person or with the help of special devices.\r\n\r\n\"You\" means the Customer and (where the context permits) includes any Authorised Users.\r\n<h2><strong>\r\n</strong>Account information</h2>\r\nTo lawfully use our Services, you must be at least at the age your country of residence defines as the least age to offer information society services.\r\n\r\nYou agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete account information, and to maintain and promptly update your account information to ensure that it remains true, accurate, current, and complete. We will use that information to contact you from time to time, so it is important that you keep all of your contact details, and those of your Authorised Users, up to date.\r\n<h2><strong>\r\n</strong>Use of your account</h2>\r\nCavius grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to use the Services for the purposes of with the Customer's business and in accordance with these Terms.\r\n\r\nYou are responsible for any conduct or activity undertaken in your account, including any changes made, and the input or modification of or access to any data or information in your account, by any of your Authorised Users. You control each Authorised User’s level of access to the Services at all times and can revoke or change an Authorised User’s access, or level of access, at any time and for any reason, in which case that person or entity will cease to be an Authorised User or shall have that different level of access, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nIf:\r\n(a) you are an Authorised User using or accessing the Services for the benefit of an Customer, then you are responsible for ensuring you have the right to do so from the relevant Customer (including all necessary authorisations to access, amend or remove data, or make changes to the Customer's account); or\r\n(b) you are a Customer, then you are responsible for authorising use or access of the Services by any Authorised User and will indemnify Cavius against any claims or loss relating to any Authorised User's use of or access to your account.\r\n\r\nYou acknowledge and agree that, if there is any dispute between a Customer and an Authorised User regarding access to Services, the Customer shall decide what access or level of access to the relevant Data or Services that Authorized User shall have, if any. We will have no responsibility to anyone other than the Customer, and the Services and these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the Customer and not for any Authorised User(s).\r\n<h2><strong>\r\n</strong>Cancellation of accounts</h2>\r\nWe can cancel or suspend your account at any time on written notice to you. Such termination will be effective at the end of your then-current paid-up subscription period. We may also cancel or suspend your account immediately if, in our sole discretion:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>you have committed a material or persistent breach of these Terms or any other terms applying to your use of the Services;</li>\r\n \t<li>we consider that provision of the Services, or use of them, in your territory or jurisdiction will or is likely to breach any applicable law;</li>\r\n \t<li>we decide to withdraw the Services from your territory or jurisdiction altogether; or</li>\r\n \t<li>you fail to comply with any limits or restrictions (e.g, on the number of users, stores or transactions) applicable to your plan;</li>\r\n \t<li>your use of the account is creating a security or availability risk for Cavius International Limited or our other customers, is impacting (or may impact) the stability or performance of our systems, or is requiring disproportionate resource to deliver (eg, in terms of storage or processing requirements, support requests or helpdesk queries).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou are entitled to cancel your account with Cavius at any time. You can request to cancel your account by sending an email to support@mylekha.app. If you cancel your account before the end of your current paid up month or year, your cancellation will take effect immediately and you will not be entitled to any refund of Fees paid in advance (unless we agree otherwise).\r\n\r\nIf your account is cancelled, your account will be deactivated and all of your rights granted under these Terms will immediately come to an end (except to the extent that it is necessary for them to continue in respect of our ongoing storage of your data up to the date of permanent deletion). We are not liable for any loss or damage following, or as a result of, cancellation of your account, and it is your responsibility to ensure that any content or data which you require is exported, backed-up or replicated before cancellation.\r\n<h2><strong>\r\n</strong>Fees and taxes</h2>\r\nThe fees charged for use of the Services are set out on the Website (or as notified to you in the case of some exclusive plans) (\"Fees\") and are subject to change. We can change the Fees, and/or introduce new pricing packages and terms, at any time by giving you 14 days' prior notice. The new Fees or pricing/package terms will apply to you from expiry of that notice, unless you choose to cancel subscription before the changes take effect. Also, the new Fees will apply to you immediately if you choose to change your plan/package (or if you reactivate your plan after cancellation). Fees are charged in advance on a monthly or annual basis and are non-refundable, including if you only use part of a month or year's subscription for the Services. Unless required by law, we will not provide refunds in connection with the Services. A valid credit card number is required for paying all Fees.\r\n\r\nIf you are carrying out a free trial of the Services, the free trial will begin on the day that you subscribe for an optional add-on and end of the published trial period. If you wish to continue to use the Services at the end of the free trial period, you will need to provide valid credit card details (unless you choose to use any free Services). All Fees are exclusive of all taxes and you are responsible for any taxes that may arise. You indemnify and hold Mylekha armless against any claims by any tax authority for any underpayment of any sales, use, goods and services, value added or other tax or levy, and any penalties and/or interest. If you are required to withhold or deduct tax from the Fees, you will pay MyLekha such additional amounts as are necessary to ensure receipt of the full amount which would have been received but for the deduction.\r\n\r\nBy subscribing to optional add-ons, you agree and authorize us to automatically charge the payment method provided at the start of each billing period (monthly or annually) until you cancel the subscription.\r\n\r\nPayment of your Fees could incur additional bank fees at the discretion of your bank. Bank fees may be charged for currency conversion and international settlement; and your charge may still be subject to additional fees even if you are being charged by MyLekha in your local currency. If your credit card statement charge differs from your invoice, please contact your bank in the first instance. MyLekha is not liable for any additional bank transaction fees that may be charged.\r\n<h3><strong>\r\nYou may upgrade or downgrade your account at any time</strong></h3>\r\nYou may upgrade or downgrade your account (for example, add or delete employee accounts and stores, subscribe or unsubscribe from optional add-ons) at any time by when you are logged into your account.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade or downgrade will become effective immediately. If you downgrade your account, no refunds will be paid in respect of any unused portion of any higher account offering. If you upgrade your account, the balance already paid for the rest of the term will be credited to your account. We will then immediately charge your credit card for any net amount due as a result of the upgrade and your account renewal date will be reset to the next available billing day.\r\n\r\nDowngrading your account may cause the loss of content, features, or capacity of your account. If you choose to downgrade your account, Mylekha does not accept any liability for the resulting loss of data, content, features or capacity.\r\n<h3><strong>\r\nPlan limits and reasonable use</strong></h3>\r\nThe Services are available in a range of packages/plans, giving you options including in relation to the number of stores and employees you have, and the features and services you have access to, and the Fee you pay, as described on our Website from time to time (or as notified to you, in the case of some exclusive plans). We may update those plan limits at any time (eg, by increasing, reducing or removing limits) by updating the plan descriptions on our Website (or as notified to you, in the case of some exclusive plans). You'll be expected to comply with the updated plan limits from the next time you use the Services. You agree that we may use information generated by your use of the Services (eg, transaction volume and revenue) for the purposes of determining the most appropriate plan and pricing for you.\r\n\r\nWe may ask you to upgrade your account to a new plan if you exceed the limits that apply to your plan at any time.\r\n\r\nWe also reserve the right to suspend or restrict your account or your use of the Service, where we believe that your use isn't fair or reasonable or that it may cause degradation of the Services to other users. This includes circumstances where your use is creating a security or availability risk for Mylekha or our other customers, is impacting (or may impact) the stability or performance of our systems, or is requiring disproportionate resource to deliver (eg, in terms of storage or processing requirements, support requests or helpdesk queries).\r\n<h3><strong>\r\nDisclaimer of Warranties</strong></h3>\r\nTHE USE OF THE SERVICES IS CARRIED OUT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

By clicking “Accept” or using any of the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these Terms, and that you have agreed to these Terms on behalf of any person or entity for whom you are using the Services.\r\n\r\nIf you do not agree to any of these Terms, then you should not use the Services. All rights not expressly granted in these Terms are reserved by O.N.E Click Solution.\r\n\r\nWe may change these Terms from time to time by posting updates to the Website. You are advised to check the Terms from time to time for any updates or changes that may impact you and if you do not accept such amendments, you must cease using the Services.\r\n\r\nThese Terms of Use were updated on 2 December 2020.\r\n<h2><strong>\r\n</strong>Definitions</h2>\r\nTo help you read and understand these Terms, we've set out definitions of some key terms below:\r\n\r\n\"Customer\" means the person or entity who registers to use the Service by creating a My Lekha account. If you are creating an account or using the Services on behalf of a business, you agree that you are accepting these Terms and have the authority to enter into these Terms, on behalf of the business, which will be deemed to be the Customer, and will be bound by these Terms.\r\n\r\n\"Authorised User\" means any person or entity that a Customer authorises to use the Service on its behalf. This includes employees and personnel of the Customer who are authorised to use the Services on the Customer's behalf, but also includes support partners and other third parties with whom a Customer shares its My Lekha account details (and for whose conduct the Customer is responsible).\r\n\r\n“Personal Data” means any Data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person), such as your first and last name, identity number, e-mail address, address and province, telephone number, education details and training records, employment data, financial and / or banking data, as well as other data related to demographics, other (online) contact data and possibly health related data, etc.\r\n\r\n“Sensitive Data” means any data revealing a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetics, biometrics, health data, data about sex life or sexual orientation, or data about criminal convictions and offences.\r\n\r\n\"We\" or \" My Lekha  \" O.N.E Click Solution\r\n\r\n\"Services\" means My Lekha  point of sale and inventory management products and services, and any features, technologies or functionality provided by those products or services, offered by us from time to time, including the My Lekha , My Lekha Dashboard, My Lekha KD and My Lekha CD applications (\"Apps\") and mylekha.app (\"Website\"). Your use of the Services will also be subject to any allowances and/or limits that apply to the Mylekha plan which you've purchased.\r\n\r\n\"Content\" – text, graphics, audio and video materials, documentation, information posted in Apps or Website, perceivable by a person or with the help of special devices.\r\n\r\n\"You\" means the Customer and (where the context permits) includes any Authorised Users.\r\n<h2><strong>\r\n</strong>Account information</h2>\r\nTo lawfully use our Services, you must be at least at the age your country of residence defines as the least age to offer information society services.\r\n\r\nYou agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete account information, and to maintain and promptly update your account information to ensure that it remains true, accurate, current, and complete. We will use that information to contact you from time to time, so it is important that you keep all of your contact details, and those of your Authorised Users, up to date.\r\n<h2><strong>\r\n</strong>Use of your account</h2>\r\nCavius grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to use the Services for the purposes of with the Customer's business and in accordance with these Terms.\r\n\r\nYou are responsible for any conduct or activity undertaken in your account, including any changes made, and the input or modification of or access to any data or information in your account, by any of your Authorised Users. You control each Authorised User’s level of access to the Services at all times and can revoke or change an Authorised User’s access, or level of access, at any time and for any reason, in which case that person or entity will cease to be an Authorised User or shall have that different level of access, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nIf:\r\n(a) you are an Authorised User using or accessing the Services for the benefit of an Customer, then you are responsible for ensuring you have the right to do so from the relevant Customer (including all necessary authorisations to access, amend or remove data, or make changes to the Customer's account); or\r\n(b) you are a Customer, then you are responsible for authorising use or access of the Services by any Authorised User and will indemnify Cavius against any claims or loss relating to any Authorised User's use of or access to your account.\r\n\r\nYou acknowledge and agree that, if there is any dispute between a Customer and an Authorised User regarding access to Services, the Customer shall decide what access or level of access to the relevant Data or Services that Authorized User shall have, if any. We will have no responsibility to anyone other than the Customer, and the Services and these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the Customer and not for any Authorised User(s).\r\n<h2><strong>\r\n</strong>Cancellation of accounts</h2>\r\nWe can cancel or suspend your account at any time on written notice to you. Such termination will be effective at the end of your then-current paid-up subscription period. We may also cancel or suspend your account immediately if, in our sole discretion:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>you have committed a material or persistent breach of these Terms or any other terms applying to your use of the Services;</li>\r\n \t<li>we consider that provision of the Services, or use of them, in your territory or jurisdiction will or is likely to breach any applicable law;</li>\r\n \t<li>we decide to withdraw the Services from your territory or jurisdiction altogether; or</li>\r\n \t<li>you fail to comply with any limits or restrictions (e.g, on the number of users, stores or transactions) applicable to your plan;</li>\r\n \t<li>your use of the account is creating a security or availability risk for Cavius International Limited or our other customers, is impacting (or may impact) the stability or performance of our systems, or is requiring disproportionate resource to deliver (eg, in terms of storage or processing requirements, support requests or helpdesk queries).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou are entitled to cancel your account with Cavius at any time. You can request to cancel your account by sending an email to support@mylekha.app. If you cancel your account before the end of your current paid up month or year, your cancellation will take effect immediately and you will not be entitled to any refund of Fees paid in advance (unless we agree otherwise).\r\n\r\nIf your account is cancelled, your account will be deactivated and all of your rights granted under these Terms will immediately come to an end (except to the extent that it is necessary for them to continue in respect of our ongoing storage of your data up to the date of permanent deletion). We are not liable for any loss or damage following, or as a result of, cancellation of your account, and it is your responsibility to ensure that any content or data which you require is exported, backed-up or replicated before cancellation.\r\n<h2><strong>\r\n</strong>Fees and taxes</h2>\r\nThe fees charged for use of the Services are set out on the Website (or as notified to you in the case of some exclusive plans) (\"Fees\") and are subject to change. We can change the Fees, and/or introduce new pricing packages and terms, at any time by giving you 14 days' prior notice. The new Fees or pricing/package terms will apply to you from expiry of that notice, unless you choose to cancel subscription before the changes take effect. Also, the new Fees will apply to you immediately if you choose to change your plan/package (or if you reactivate your plan after cancellation). Fees are charged in advance on a monthly or annual basis and are non-refundable, including if you only use part of a month or year's subscription for the Services. Unless required by law, we will not provide refunds in connection with the Services. A valid credit card number is required for paying all Fees.\r\n\r\nIf you are carrying out a free trial of the Services, the free trial will begin on the day that you subscribe for an optional add-on and end of the published trial period. If you wish to continue to use the Services at the end of the free trial period, you will need to provide valid credit card details (unless you choose to use any free Services). All Fees are exclusive of all taxes and you are responsible for any taxes that may arise. You indemnify and hold Mylekha armless against any claims by any tax authority for any underpayment of any sales, use, goods and services, value added or other tax or levy, and any penalties and/or interest. If you are required to withhold or deduct tax from the Fees, you will pay MyLekha such additional amounts as are necessary to ensure receipt of the full amount which would have been received but for the deduction.\r\n\r\nBy subscribing to optional add-ons, you agree and authorize us to automatically charge the payment method provided at the start of each billing period (monthly or annually) until you cancel the subscription.\r\n\r\nPayment of your Fees could incur additional bank fees at the discretion of your bank. Bank fees may be charged for currency conversion and international settlement; and your charge may still be subject to additional fees even if you are being charged by MyLekha in your local currency. If your credit card statement charge differs from your invoice, please contact your bank in the first instance. MyLekha is not liable for any additional bank transaction fees that may be charged.\r\n<h3><strong>\r\nYou may upgrade or downgrade your account at any time</strong></h3>\r\nYou may upgrade or downgrade your account (for example, add or delete employee accounts and stores, subscribe or unsubscribe from optional add-ons) at any time by when you are logged into your account.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade or downgrade will become effective immediately. If you downgrade your account, no refunds will be paid in respect of any unused portion of any higher account offering. If you upgrade your account, the balance already paid for the rest of the term will be credited to your account. We will then immediately charge your credit card for any net amount due as a result of the upgrade and your account renewal date will be reset to the next available billing day.\r\n\r\nDowngrading your account may cause the loss of content, features, or capacity of your account. If you choose to downgrade your account, Mylekha does not accept any liability for the resulting loss of data, content, features or capacity.\r\n<h3><strong>\r\nPlan limits and reasonable use</strong></h3>\r\nThe Services are available in a range of packages/plans, giving you options including in relation to the number of stores and employees you have, and the features and services you have access to, and the Fee you pay, as described on our Website from time to time (or as notified to you, in the case of some exclusive plans). We may update those plan limits at any time (eg, by increasing, reducing or removing limits) by updating the plan descriptions on our Website (or as notified to you, in the case of some exclusive plans). You'll be expected to comply with the updated plan limits from the next time you use the Services. You agree that we may use information generated by your use of the Services (eg, transaction volume and revenue) for the purposes of determining the most appropriate plan and pricing for you.\r\n\r\nWe may ask you to upgrade your account to a new plan if you exceed the limits that apply to your plan at any time.\r\n\r\nWe also reserve the right to suspend or restrict your account or your use of the Service, where we believe that your use isn't fair or reasonable or that it may cause degradation of the Services to other users. This includes circumstances where your use is creating a security or availability risk for Mylekha or our other customers, is impacting (or may impact) the stability or performance of our systems, or is requiring disproportionate resource to deliver (eg, in terms of storage or processing requirements, support requests or helpdesk queries).\r\n<h3><strong>\r\nDisclaimer of Warranties</strong></h3>\r\nTHE USE OF THE SERVICES IS CARRIED OUT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
